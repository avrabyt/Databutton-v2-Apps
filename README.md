# Databutton-v2-Apps
**Building Full Stack Web Apps using AI Agents. Python as the backend and React (with Chakra-UI) as the front-end.**

## What are we building?
Full stack apps, with user-friendly Python for backend development and robust React for the frontend. This is further enhanced with the [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com) library, a component-based system that aids in creating responsive and visually appealing interfaces.

## Tool in use
[Databutton](https://www.databutton.io) - an **online platform** that simplifies app creation, making it **conversational and operationally-ready**. It introduces a unique approach with two **AI agents**, **Brain** and **Builder**, collaborating in the app development process. These agents work together, utilizing the latest AI stacks to seamlessly integrate **Python** and **ReactJS**. 

**Think of these agents as your development companions, guiding you through each step, allowing you to focus on refining your ideas and solving important problems.**

## Tasks performed by the AI Agents 

âœ… Brainstorming the initial ideas in natural language

âœ… Suggestion Backend functionalities / capabilities

âœ… Generating FastAPI endpoints

âœ… Designing the UI layout

âœ… Building the UI in ReactJS (using the Chakra-ui component)

âœ… Managing secrets, package installations , API calls etc 

âœ… Generate, debug and self execute code 

## Do I need to know coding?
Most tasks are done via **prompting**. However, I won't say it is an alternative to programming,rather your **companion while developing**. 

## What will this repo consists of?
Projects finished with Databutton v2. That means,all the front-end and backend related files. Requirements files.
